\section{Introduction}

In the introduction, we will introduce the concept of machine learning and write about its current/potential applications. We will then begin to talk about why math is critical to the field and how math is used to devise machine learning models.

\section{Main Section}
In this section, we will define many terms related to machine learning including  cost function, regression, classification, neural networks. We will provide the many formulas related to these terms and provide sample implementations of some of these functions and algorithms in python.
\section{Proofs}
In this section, we are going to show two proofs related to machine learning. We are most likely going to focus on proving the convergence of gradient descent and proving the cost function for linear regression.
\section{Conclusion}
Here, we will write a conclusion about the project.
\section{References}
Here, we will list all of the references we use in our project.
